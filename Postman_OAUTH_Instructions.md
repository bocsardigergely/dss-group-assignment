# Postman usage

_So how the heck am I supposed to work with this?_

Here are the instructions Asaf sent on Whatsapp. If you have further questions, ask him.

**Postman**
1. Download the app 
2. Import the collection
3. Open it by clicking it (it's the collection called Spotify)
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the orange button "Get New Access Token"
5. Copy the new access token and refresh tokens and put them aside for now

**Git**

6. Clone the repo if you haven't already
7. Add the credentials file I'm about to send in the chat
8. Put the credentials file in the repo's main directory (just in the highest level of the folder)
9. Replace the old access token and refresh tokens with the new ones you just generated

**Code**

10. Now you should be able to make requests normally
